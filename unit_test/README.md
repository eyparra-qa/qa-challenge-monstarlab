## Unit Test Description ⚙️

I made a basic unit test, with 2 methods, one is to use add operation and the another one is to use multiplication.

| N | Description                    | Method      | entries value       | output expected | status |
|---|--------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------|

| 2 | Test multiplication operation  | multiply    | 2 + 3               | 6               | ok     |
